## Decentralized identity and authorization management system

### Welcome to cryptoident!

This project implements a Decentralized Identity and Authorization Management System powered by a lightweight, custom blockchain. Developed in Python, it aims to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution for managing identities and permissions in decentralized environments.

#### Key Features:
1. Decentralized Identity: Users can create, manage, and verify identities without relying on centralized authorities, enhancing privacy and security.

2. Blockchain Integration: The project utilizes a simple blockchain for recording identity transactions, ensuring data integrity and immutability.

3. Authorization Management: Fine-grained control over access and permissions, allowing trusted interactions between users and services in a decentralized way.
